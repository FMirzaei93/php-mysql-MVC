# php-mysql-MVC

This is a simple php project using mysql that's made by MVC architecture.</br>
In database I have a table called 'articles' and you can see the table columns name in Statics.php file.</br>
I'm using PhpMyAdmin as my database server for reading and writing data.</br>

# Note: 
1.A it's a php project(and it can only be run on a server), don't forget to first run a server(using mamp, EasyPhp or something else), and then open the project from your localhost in the browser.</br>
2.Check the config.ini file to make sure that your db is running on the same port as the one in congig.ini.
